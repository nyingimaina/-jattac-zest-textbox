# Standard Workplan

This document outlines the standard workflow for developing new features or fixing bugs.

### 1. Task Initiation
-   The project stakeholder (you) initiates a task by describing a new feature or bug.

### 2. Specification Phase
-   The lead developer (me) analyzes the request and creates a detailed technical specification for approval.
-   The specification covers the feature description, API changes (props), UI/UX impact, and a technical implementation plan.

### 3. Implementation Phase
-   Once the specification is approved, the lead developer implements the changes, including code, styles, and tests.

### 4. Verification Phase
-   After implementation, the developer runs all verification steps, such as building the project, running tests, and linting, to ensure quality.

### 5. Completion
-   Once all checks pass, the task is considered complete, and the developer awaits the next task.

### 6. Documentation
-   After verification, the developer will update the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation to reflect the changes made in the task.
