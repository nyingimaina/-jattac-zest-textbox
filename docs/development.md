## Internal Architecture

The `ZestTextbox` component is designed with maintainability, readability, and reusability in mind. Its core logic is distributed across several modular units, promoting a clear separation of concerns and making it easier to understand, test, and extend.

*   **`UI/ZestTextbox.tsx`**: The main component file, responsible for orchestrating the various hooks, sub-components, and applying final rendering logic. It acts as the central hub for the `ZestTextbox` instance.
*   **`UI/hooks/`**: Contains custom React hooks that encapsulate specific behaviors and logic. This promotes reusability and keeps the main component lean. Examples include `useThemeDetector` for theme management, `usePasswordVisibility` for toggling password input visibility, and `useParsedAndValidatedInput` for handling complex input processing.
*   **`UI/components/`**: Houses smaller, focused UI components used internally by `ZestTextbox`. These are typically presentational components that receive data and callbacks from the main `ZestTextbox` or its hooks. Examples include `PasswordToggleButton`, `CharacterCounter`, `ProgressBar`, and `HelperTextDisplay`.
*   **`UI/utils/`**: Contains pure utility functions that perform specific tasks, such as `numericInputFilter` for input sanitization and `defaultParsersAndValidators` for common input types.
*   **`UI/types.ts`**: The single source of truth for all shared TypeScript interfaces and types across the project, ensuring strong type-safety and clear API contracts.
*   **`UI/contexts/`**: Contains React Contexts and Providers (e.g., `ZestTextboxConfigContext`, `ZestTextboxConfigProvider`) that enable the powerful [Centralized Configuration](./configuration.md) system.
*   **`Styles/ZestTextbox.module.css`**: Defines the module-scoped CSS styles for the component, ensuring no global style collisions.

## Development Setup

To get started with local development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nyingimaina/-jattac-zest-textbox.git
    cd jattac.libs.web.zest-textbox
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install all required development dependencies, including Rollup, TypeScript, PostCSS, and React type definitions.
3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles the TypeScript source code into JavaScript (`dist/index.js`, `dist/index.esm.js`) and generates TypeScript declaration files (`dist/index.d.ts`).

## Available Scripts

The project uses `npm` scripts for common development tasks:

*   **`npm run build`**:
    *   **Description:** Compiles the project using Rollup. It first builds the main JavaScript output and then generates TypeScript declaration files.
    *   **Command:** `rollup -c && rollup -c rollup.config.dts.js`
*   **`npm run postbuild`**:
    *   **Description:** A hook that runs automatically after `npm run build`. It cleans up specific, redundant TypeScript declaration files from the `dist` directory.
    *   **Command:** `rimraf dist/ZestTextbox.d.ts dist/IconEyeOpen.d.ts dist/IconEyeSlashed.d.ts`
*   **`npm test`**:
    *   **Description:** Currently, there are no dedicated unit or integration tests configured for this project. This script will simply output a message.
    *   **Command:** `echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1`
    *   **Note:** If you are adding new features, please consider including tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your changes.

## Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to the project, please adhere to the following:

*   **Code Style:** Follow the existing code style and conventions.
*   **TypeScript:** All new code should be written in TypeScript, leveraging its type-safety features.
*   **Modularity:** Maintain the modular architecture by creating new hooks, components, or utilities as appropriate, rather than adding monolithic logic to existing files.
*   **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation files (`.md`) for any new features, changes, or API modifications.
*   **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests against the `main` branch. Ensure your PR description clearly explains the changes and their motivation.
